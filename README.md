# `Json schema form` generator Sample with `angular-seed` 

This project is an application skeleton for a typical [AngularJS][angularjs] web app. It includes a json schema form generator.


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the repository. You can get git from [here][git].

You must have Node.js and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from [here][node].

### Install Dependencies

The project is preconfigured to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`. After that, you should find out that you have
two new folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the Angular framework files


### Run the Application

The simplest way to start the server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/index.html`][local-app-url].
